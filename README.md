# LA #311 Dataset

[P-ai's](https://www.p-ai.org/) #311 team is working with [Hack For LA](https://www.hackforla.org/#hack-nights) on performing 
data analysis and machine learning on data from the city of Los Angeles. The goal of this project is to build a data pipeline which, for
every area in LA, creates a dataset containing the number of pedestrian and vehicle stops, crimes committed, arrests, and #311
service requests per day for every day between January 1st, 2017 and December 31st, 2019. 

We are building this pipeline using the following datasets from the city of LA's offical website: 

[LA Vehicle and Pedestrian Stop Data](https://data.lacity.org/A-Safe-City/Vehicle-and-Pedestrian-Stop-Data-2010-to-Present/ci25-wgt7)<br/>
[LA Crime Data](https://data.lacity.org/A-Safe-City/Crime-Data-from-2010-to-2019/63jg-8b9z)<br/>
[LA Arrest Data](https://data.lacity.org/A-Safe-City/Arrest-Data-from-2010-to-Present/yru6-6re4)<br/>
[LA #311 Requests Data](https://data.lacity.org/browse?category=A+Well+Run+City&limitTo=filters&q=%22MyLA311+Service+Request+Data+201%22&sortBy=relevance)
